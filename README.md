# ticTacToe

A Tic Tac Toe to play in the broswer. The goal is to have as little global code and keep all of it in contained boxes like factory functions for encapsulation. Then make that factory function a IIFE to not be reused as it should perform its one purpose, having two players play a game until game ends in either win or draw.
